# Infinite Planner
Infinite Planner is the name of a series of tools built to improve and ease the Flight Planning experience for Infinite Flight.

# FPL Cleaner / Optimizer
Perfect for virtual pilots looking for more accurate and efficient route planning.

The script converts a FlightRadar24 KML file to an optimized KML file with the limitations of Infinite Flight. 

Flight Planner enhances the flight planning experience in Infinite Flight by optimizing existing and past flight KML files. It intelligently cleans up flight paths by:
- Filtering unnecessary waypoints, keeping only essential turns.
- Limiting waypoints to improve efficiency (max 250).
- Streamline your flight planning with Flight Planner and focus on a smoother Infinite Flight experience. üöÄ‚úàÔ∏è

Soon, it may:
- Identifying step climbs, marking TOC (Top of Climb) & TOD (Top of Descent).
- Detecting and rounding altitudes to the nearest 100 ft.
- Allow user to custom-rename waypoints with a custom format (e.g., AFKLM028-###).
- Manage KML files from FlightAware.
